I started by downloading the Ubuntu ISO and the Rufus program. Then I formated my USB and created the live USB using Rufus. After, I shrunk the C drive in my PC
to create a 50GB partition on which then ew OS will be installed. Then I entered UEFI boot settings and booted the PC from the live USB and followed the Ubuntu 
set up procedure from the provided turtorial.
