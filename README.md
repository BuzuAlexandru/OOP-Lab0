I started by downloading the Ubuntu ISO and the Rufus program. Then I formated my USB and created the live USB using Rufus. After, I shrunk the C drive in my PC
to create a 50GB partition on which then ew OS will be installed. Then I entered UEFI boot settings and booted the PC from the live USB and followed the Ubuntu 
set up procedure from the provided turtorial. Aditionally I installed Grub Customizer using the terminal with which I was able to change Windows back as the default OS.
 
When I finished customizing my Ubuntu I used the terminal to install zsh and oh-my-zsh and changed the theme to "gnzh" and added the "adb" plugin.

For the last task I installed git and GCC, make was already installed. I followed the provided tutorial and set my local repository. I then wrote a Hello world program in VS Code and compiled it using GCC and then using a makefile and make. After, I commited the changes and pushed them to the main branch in the remote repository. I used gh to log in to my GitHub account.
